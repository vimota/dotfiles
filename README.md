# dotfiles 
Gotta have my dotfiles! Plays nicely with: 

- git
- vim
- tmux
- oh-my-zsh
- rbenv

# Installation
Use [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to install these dotfiles. Yes, it requires [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)! Thankfully it works on `1.8.7` so you can still be an old tard.

    $ gem install homesick
    $ homesick clone vimota/dotfiles
    $ homesick symlink dotfiles

## vim
`vim` uses the [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme. Please refer to their instructions are getting it to properly display in your terminal of choice.

# Chef
There's a [Chef](http://chef.io) cookbook that exists in getting these dotfiles setup in a jiffy. [You can find it right here!](https://github.com/axsuul/cookbook-dotfiles)
